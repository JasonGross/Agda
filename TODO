Syntax
------

  * Invent syntax for fancy case (should we have fancy case?)

ToConcrete
----------

  * private
  * fixity declarations

Error reporting
---------------

  * Check out lex/parse errors (what position and what input is reported).

  * Think about laziness and exceptions. In particular in the scope checking.

 vim: sts=2 sw=2 ts=80
