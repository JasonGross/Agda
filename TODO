----

* good error messages

* when instantiating a module we should generate functions for the axioms and
  constructors and probably for everything else as well (reducing to the
  instantiated versions from the instantiated module).

* Monomorphic constructors.

* Blocked constructor in Terms and Types(?)

* getopts

* debug information

* optimise

(done) insert hidden arguments in lhss

(done) ranges in error messages

(done) abstract info on constraints (TCEnv instead of Context)
       and interaction meta vars






Syntax
------

  * Invent syntax for fancy case (should we have fancy case?)

Error reporting
---------------

  * Check out lex/parse errors (what position and what input is reported).

  * Think about laziness and exceptions. In particular in the scope checking.
