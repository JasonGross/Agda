Module system talk
------------------

Purpose of the talk:

  - explain our module system
  - why we think it's good
  - get feedback

Important points:

  - talk about implementation

Outline

  - explain the idea
    + simple
    + separate scope checking and type checking

  - describe the module system (simplified?)
    + use examples

  - describe the implementation
    + scope checking
    + the view of the type checker

Before scope checking:

  Unmodified source program (local names, hierarchical modules)

After scope checking:

  Fully qualified names
    - A.B.C.f
    - A.B.x

  Still hierarchical module structure

  How does it work?
    - keeps track of renamings
    - basically keeps a map from local name to fully qualified name

  Maybe scope checking should flatten the module space? No, instantiating a
  module would be a problem then. Or would it?

After type checking

  Flat module structure
    - A.B.C -> { f, g, h }
    - A.B   -> { x, y }
