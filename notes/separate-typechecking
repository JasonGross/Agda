When and how to create/read interface files
-------------------------------------------

We need information from imports twice: at scope checking, and at type checking.
We can go about this in a few different ways:

- read interface file twice, first at scope checking (possibly creating it) and second
  at type checking

- read the interface once, and store the type information for use at type
  checking time

Other concerns
--------------

- What happens when we do import from inside a parameterised module? Top-level
  modules can be parameterised.

- Can we do imports anywhere? Does it make sense. Probably, but is it a good
  thing? Options:

  - imports anywhere

  - only in top-level module

  - only first in top-level module (Haskell-style)

  - before the top-level module (java-style)
