Our goal is to prove that we only compute with well-typed terms, in the sense
of {\Core}. This guarantees the existence of normal forms, and hence, ensure
decidability of type checking.

\begin{lemma}[Well-formed signatures]
    All the rules preserve well-formed signatures. More precisely, for $J$
    ranging over the type checking and convertibility checking judgements we
    have
    \[{\ExplicitJudgement \Sigma J {\Sigma'}} \, \mathrel{\wedge} \,
	{\IsSigCS \Sigma}  ~ \implies ~ \IsSigCS {\Sigma'}
    \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    By induction on the derivation of $\ExplicitJudgement \Sigma J {\Sigma'}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Signature extension]
    We say that $\Sigma'$ {\em extends} $\Sigma$ if and only if
    \[\begin{array}{lcl}
	\IsTypeCS \Sigma \Gamma A & \implies & \IsTypeCS {\Sigma'} \Gamma A \\
	\HasTypeCS \Sigma \Gamma M A & \implies & \HasTypeCS {\Sigma'} \Gamma M A
    \end{array}\]
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma} \label{lemExtendSig}
    If $\ExplicitJudgement \Sigma J {\Sigma'}$ then $\Sigma'$ extends $\Sigma$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Soundness of term convertibility checking] \label{thmConvSound}
    If two terms are checked convertible relative to a set of constraints, then
    any solution to these constraints makes the terms convertible in {\Core}.
    More precisely, if
    \begin{itemize}
	\item \( \HasTypeCS \Sigma \Gamma M A ~ \wedge ~
		 \HasTypeCS \Sigma \Gamma N A
	      \)
	\item $\ExplicitJudgement \Sigma {\Equal M N A \Cs} {\Sigma'}$
	\item $ \Extends {\Sigma_1} {\Sigma'}$
	\item $\ExplicitJudgement
		{\Sigma_1}
		{\CheckConstr \Cs \emptyset}
		{\Sigma_2}
	      $
    \end{itemize}
    then \( \EqualCS {\Sigma_2} \Gamma M N A \)
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    The interesting case is meta variable instantiation.
\end{proof}

The soundness of type convertibility checking is expressed in the same way.

\begin{lemma}[Soundness of type convertibility checking]
    If
    \begin{itemize}
	\item \( \IsTypeCS \Sigma \Gamma A ~ \wedge ~
		 \IsTypeCS \Sigma \Gamma B
	      \)
	\item $\ExplicitJudgement \Sigma {\EqualType A B \Cs} {\Sigma'}$
	\item $ \Extends {\Sigma_1} {\Sigma'}$
	\item $\ExplicitJudgement
		{\Sigma_1}
		{\CheckConstr \Cs \emptyset}
		{\Sigma_2}
	      $
    \end{itemize}
    then \( \EqualTypeCS {\Sigma_2} \Gamma A B \)
\end{lemma}

\begin{corollary} \label{corConvSound}
    If $\ExplicitJudgement \Sigma {\EqualType A B \emptyset} {\Sigma'}$ then
    $\EqualTypeCS {\Sigma'} \Gamma A B$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem}[Type-safety] \label{thmTypeSafety}
    Terms produced by type checking are type correct in {\Core} regardless of any
    constraints.

    \[\begin{array}{lcl}
	{\ExplicitJudgement \Sigma {\IsType e A} {\Sigma'}}
	& \implies & {\IsTypeCS {\CoreSig{\Sigma'}} \Gamma A} \\
	{\ExplicitJudgement \Sigma {\CheckType e A M} {\Sigma'}}
	\, \wedge \, {\IsTypeCS {\CoreSig \Sigma} \Gamma A}
	& \implies & \HasTypeCS {\CoreSig{\Sigma'}} \Gamma M A \\
	{\ExplicitJudgement \Sigma {\InferType e A M} {\Sigma'}}
	& \implies & \HasTypeCS {\CoreSig{\Sigma'}} \Gamma M A
    \end{array}\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    The proof is straighforward by induction on the typing derivation. In the
    case of the conversion rule, if the types are convertible without producing
    any constraints we rely on the soundness of the convertibility checker
    (Corollary~\ref{corConvSound}). If there are constraints the resulting term
    is a fresh constant that is well-typed by definition.
\end{proof}

Since well-typed terms in {\Core} have weak head normal forms we get the
existence of weak head normal forms for type checked terms.

\begin{corollary}
    Type checked terms have weak head normal forms.
\end{corollary}

Once we have weak head normal forms it is easy to verify that the rules
describe a decidable type checking algorithm.

\begin{corollary}
    Type checking is decidable.
\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem}[Soundness]
    If all meta variables are solved and all guards are empty, then we are fine. More precisely, if
    \begin{itemize}
	\item $\ExplicitJudgement \Sigma {\CheckType e A M} {\Sigma'}$
	\item ${\ExplicitJudgement {\Sigma'} \Simplify {\Sigma''}}$
	\item ${\Implements {\Sigma''} {\Sigma}}$ (everything new in $\Sigma''$ has been {\em solved})
	\item ${\ExplicitJudgement {\Sigma''} {\Inline M {\hat M}} {\Sigma''}}$
    \end{itemize}
    then $\HasTypeCS \Sigma \Gamma {\hat M} A$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Follows from Theorem \ref{thmTypeSafety} and Lemma \ref{lemExtendSig} and
    some property of inlining.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Completeness]
    We are only complete in the sense that if there exists a solution, we find
    an approximation of it.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    To give the proof we would have to spell out when type checking fails in
    more detail.
\end{proof}
