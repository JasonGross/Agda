In this paper we present a type checking algorithm for a dependently typed logical framework extended
with meta-variables. It is common for such frameworks to accept that unification creates 
substitutions that are not well typed 
\cite{dowek:matching,elliot:unification,pym:thesis}, but we will give a novel
approach to the treatment of meta-variables where well-typedness of
substitutions is guaranteed. To ensure type correctness the type checker 
creates an optimal well-typed approximation of the term being type checked. The main point of this paper is
 not the 
actual unification algorithm, the result probably carries over also to other algorithms than the 
restricted from of higher order pattern unification we use.
We prove that the algorithm is sound and decidable\TODO{En algoritm kan inte vara decidable}. 
The proposed algorithm has been implemented with promising results.
