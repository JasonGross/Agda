Topic: Unique names in abstract syntax.

  * The names of local functions can clash and it's not clear how to
    disambiguate them if names are (qualified) strings.

  * So unique identifiers (numbers) for names sounds like a good idea.

  * Problem: Module system, in particular separate type checking and
    interface files. If names are identified by globally unique
    numbers we're in trouble.

  * Solution: qualified unique numbers. A name is a pair of a module
    and a unique number.

  * Question: How qualified (top-level modules or also sub-modules)?

  * Answer: It feels better to treat top-level modules and sub-modules
    the same as far as possible, so each module (including
    sub-modules) should have its own set of unique identifiers.

Topic: Module names vs. function names

  * Since there is no confusion between module names and function
  names (they can never appear in the same place) it makes sense to
  have different representations for them. For clarity if nothing
  else.
