Issue882a.agda:50,1-33
Cannot instantiate the metavariable _48 to solution m b since it
contains the variable m which is not in scope of the metavariable
or irrelevant in the metavariable but relevant in the solution
when checking that the type
B →
(w : _x_48 ≡ _x_48) →
unfold (λ m → _.mko m (m b) w) ≡ unfold (λ m → _.mko m (m b) w)
of the generated with function is well-formed
