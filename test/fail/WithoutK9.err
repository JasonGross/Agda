checking datatype _≡_
  type (parameters instantiated):    A → Set
  type (full):    A → Set
  sort:    Set
  indices: 1
  params: []
  small params: []
checking constructor refl : _≡_ x
checking that _≡_ x ends in _≡_
  nofPars = 2
these constructor parameters are non-linear: [1]
checking that the type fits in Set
does _≡_ x of sort Set fit in Set ?
adding constructor refl : _≡_ x
WithoutK9.agda:17,21-25
The indices
  {E._≡_ x}
  refl
  q
are not constructors (or literals) applied to variables (note that
parameters count as constructor arguments)
when checking that the pattern refl has type _≡_ {E._≡_ x} refl q
