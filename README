To install Agda 2, proceed as follows:

0) Install prerequisites (recent versions of GHC, Alex and Happy).

   In addition to the libraries distributed with GHC you will need the binary
   package which can be downloaded from

   http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/binary-0.2

1) Download Agda 2, perhaps as follows:

     darcs get http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~ulfn/darcs/Agda2
     cd Agda2

2) Build and install the Agda 2 library:

     runhaskell Setup.hs configure
     runhaskell Setup.hs build
     runhaskell Setup.hs install

   You may want to set some flags above, for instance as follows:

     runhaskell Setup.hs configure --prefix=~/<some path>
     runhaskell Setup.hs build
     runhaskell Setup.hs install --user

3) If you want to use the Emacs mode, build and install it (see
   src/full/Interaction/emacs-mode/README-agda2-mode.txt).

4) If you want to use the stand-alone "interpreter", build and install
   it:

     cd src/main
     runhaskell Setup.hs configure
     runhaskell Setup.hs build
     runhaskell Setup.hs install
     cd -
